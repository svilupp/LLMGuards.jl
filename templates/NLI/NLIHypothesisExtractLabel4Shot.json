Task Overview:\n    You will be presented with a longer text passage (premise) and a summary sentence (hypothesis). Your job is to determine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.\n\n2. Marking Categories:\n    - E (Entailment): The premise is definitely true based on the information in the text passage.\n    - C (Contradiction): The premise contradicts information in the text passage.\n    - N (Neutral): The premise might be true or false, but the text passage doesn't provide enough information to be certain either way.\n\n3. Steps:\n    a. Read the hypothesis carefully.\n    b. Read the premise thoroughly.\n    c. Compare the information in the hypothesis to the premise.\n    d. Identify the most important detail, fact, or statement in the premise that supports or contradicts the hypothesis.\n    e. Explain if the hypothesis is entailed by, contradicts, or is neutral to the premise. Use quotes from the premise to support your explanation.\n    f. Mark the hypothesis with E, C, or N accordingly.\n\n4. Important Considerations:\n    - Focus on the facts presented in both the hypothesis and the premise.\n    - Don't use outside knowledge; base your decision solely on the given information.\n    - A hypothesis can be neutral even if it seems likely, as long as the premise doesn't explicitly confirm it.\n    - If we have insufficient details to contradict the hypothesis, then the relationship is neutral or entailment (eg, \"exactly 10\" is neutral to \"less than 20\").\n    - Look for specific details that might contradict the hypothesis and that are explicitly stated in the premise. If no such details are found, then the relationship is neutral or entailment.\n    - Any hypothesis that is not directly contradicted by the premise is neutral or entailed.\n\n5. Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nPremise: \"The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, was completed in 1889. It stands 324 meters tall and was the world's tallest man-made structure for 41 years.\"\nHypothesis: \"The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.\" \nExplanation: The premise explicitly states that the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, so this is an entailment.\nJudgement: E\n\nExample 2:\nPremise: \"Apple Inc. was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The company's first product was the Apple I personal computer.\"\nHypothesis: \"Apple was founded by Bill Gates.\"\nExplanation: The hypothesis contradicts the information in the premise, which states that Apple was founded by Jobs, Wozniak, and Wayne, not Bill Gates.\nJudgement: C\n\nExample 3:\nPremise: \"The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, stretching for over 2,300 kilometers off the coast of Australia. It is home to diverse marine life, including many species of colorful fish.\"\nHypothesis: \"The Great Barrier Reef has over 1,500 species of fish.\" \nExplanation: The premise mentions many species of fish, but it doesn't provide a specific number. The hypothesis might be true, but we can't be certain based on the given information.\nJudgement: N\n\nExample 4:\nPremise: \"The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, stretching for over 2,300 kilometers off the coast of Australia. It is home to diverse marine life, including many species of colorful fish.\"\nHypothesis: \"The Great Barrier Reef measures exactly 2,731 kilometers.\" \nExplanation: While the premise mentions length over 2,300 kilometers, it doesn't provide a specific number to validate the hypothesis. The hypothesis might be true, but we can't be certain based on the given information.\nJudgement: N\n        \nReturn the explanation and judgement in JSON format.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"Premise: \"{{premise}}\"\nHypothesis: \"{{hypothesis}}\"\nExplanation:\n","variables":["premise","hypothesis"],"_type":"usermessage"}]
